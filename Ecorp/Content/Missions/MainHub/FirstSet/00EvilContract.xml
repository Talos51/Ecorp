Hey #PLAYERNAME#,

This is a unusual situation but... fSociety an allied hacker team requested reinforcements for his "TakeDown" operation.
They're running this operation against Ecorp, a multinational corporation, you must have heard about them ... no ? Well....

First you must get in touch with fSociety, login on their Assets server and download the file "target.txt" .

Read the file and reply when you're done.

Thanks!
