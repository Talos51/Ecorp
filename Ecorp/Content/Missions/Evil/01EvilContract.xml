#PLAYERNAME#,

Now you've got the file you know your target, Ecorp....
Ecorp .... it's too long to explain but ... We need you to shutdown the Ecorp webserver.
You'll find on our server all tools that you might need to support our cause.
You'll also find a fsociety.dat file in home/ directory.

Gain admin access on their webserver, then delete index.html, when the Ecorp server is down, upload fsociety.dat in their home/, this way we will make them know that they are not untouchable.

Reply when you're done.
