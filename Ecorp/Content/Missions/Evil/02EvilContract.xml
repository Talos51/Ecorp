#PLAYERNAME#,

The Ecorp webserver was only the tip of the iceberg, their hub server is still up and we need to gain an admin access on to discover how big is the Ecorp network.
Try to dig deeper from the Ecorp webserver to find the Ecorp hub and gain admin access then give us the password.

Reply with admin password when you're done.
