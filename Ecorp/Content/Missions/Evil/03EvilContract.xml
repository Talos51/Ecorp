#PLAYERNAME#,

Now we gained an admin access on their hub we've discovered that the ECorp CTO, Terry Colby, has planned a meeting with AllSafe Security.
You need to delete all proof that Ecorp has discovered in webserver logs.
If our knowledge of a multinational corporation is right, they must have a Drop Server where they can keep ECorp related files.
Find that Drop server and delete every files related to fSociety before Colby can meet AllSafe staff.

Reply when you're done.
