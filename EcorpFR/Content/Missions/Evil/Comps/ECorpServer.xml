  <!-- Security is a number from 0 to 5 that represents how hard it is to hack
  From 1-4 it will need that many ports to open, 4 and above will automatically
  add other security to scale it up easily, you can overwrite specifics below  -->

      Solution is the solution the player will need to find to break it, 
      the level should ideally be equal to the solution length, but can be longer
      (Not shorter though!) - additional time is the nonstandard extra evaluation time
      per step that the hacknet solver will need-->

  <!-- Auto-administrator adder - this resets the ports and stuff when the player
  disconnects. Available types are "basic" and "fast" - basic only resets after 
  15 seconds or so.
  Super admins reset passwords instantly on fast mode
